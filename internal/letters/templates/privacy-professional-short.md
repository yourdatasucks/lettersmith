Dear {{.Representative.Title}} {{.Representative.Name}},

My name is {{.Constituent.Name}}, and I am a constituent from {{.Constituent.ZipCode}} in your district. I am writing to urge your support for stronger data privacy protections that safeguard the rights of {{.Representative.State}} residents.

{{.Advocacy.SpecificConcern}} This issue affects millions of Americans who deserve control over their personal information and transparency about how companies collect, use, and share their data.

I respectfully request that you {{.Advocacy.RequestedAction}}. Data privacy is not a partisan issueâ€”it's about protecting consumers from corporate overreach and ensuring individuals have meaningful choice in how their personal information is handled.

Your leadership on this critical issue would make a significant difference for your constituents and set an important precedent for protecting digital rights.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
{{.Constituent.Name}}
Constituent from {{.Constituent.ZipCode}}
