- 🔧 Email sending workflow (connecting letter generation to email sending)

❌ **Not Yet Implemented:**
- ❌ Letter history and audit trail
- ❌ Automated scheduler for daily sending
- ❌ Template-based generation system

## Phase 1: System Health Monitoring (DONE ✅)

- [x] Add `/api/system/status` endpoint
- [x] Check database connectivity
- [x] Test email configuration
- [x] Validate AI provider setup
- [x] Monitor geocoding service
- [x] Report missing components

## Phase 2: AI Integration (COMPLETED ✅)

### 2.1 OpenAI Client Implementation ✅
```bash
internal/ai/openai.go     # OpenAI API client (COMPLETED)
internal/ai/client.go     # Common AI interface (COMPLETED)
```

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED AND WORKING (with limitations)**
- ✅ Interface and structure defined
- ✅ AI prompt template structure created (`internal/ai/templates/advocacy-prompt.txt`)
- ✅ API calls and letter generation working
- ✅ Prompt template execution and variable substitution
- ✅ Error handling and retries
- ✅ Representative selection logic
- ✅ Letter generation endpoint `/api/letters/generate`
- ⚠️ **Testing Status**: GPT-4 thoroughly tested, other models less tested
- ⚠️ **Known Issue**: Word count limitation (≤500 words reliable, >500 words problematic)

### 2.2 Anthropic Client Implementation ✅
```bash
internal/ai/anthropic.go  # Anthropic API client (COMPLETED)
```

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED AND WORKING (less tested)**
- ✅ Interface and structure defined  
- ✅ Claude API integration working
- ✅ Rate limiting compliance
- ✅ Letter generation functionality working
- ✅ Shared prompt template with OpenAI
- ⚠️ **Testing Status**: Less extensively tested than GPT-4
- ⚠️ **Potential Issue**: May have similar word count limitations as OpenAI

**Note:** AI generates letters for preview but doesn't yet save them to database or send via email.

**AI Integration Status:**
- ✅ GPT-4 integration complete and tested (with known limitations)
- ✅ Anthropic Claude integration implemented (less tested)
- ✅ Automatic representative selection working reliably
- ✅ Letter generation endpoint `/api/letters/generate` functional
- ⚠️ **Known Issue**: Word count limitation - reliably generates ≤500 words, struggles with longer requests (>500 words) despite user configuration
- 🔧 Letter persistence and email sending workflow not yet implemented

## Phase 3: Representative Lookup Service (COMPLETED ✅)

### 3.1 OpenStates Integration ✅
```bash
internal/reps/service.go       # Representative service with OpenStates integration
internal/reps/types.go         # Representative types and OpenStates API structs
internal/geocoding/openstates.go # OpenStates API client integration
```

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ Find representatives by ZIP/coordinates using OpenStates API
- ✅ Cache representative data in PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Handle API rate limits and error responses
- ✅ Privacy-focused data collection (only necessary fields)
- ✅ Web interface for syncing and viewing representatives
- ✅ CRUD operations for representative management

### 3.2 Representative Database Management ✅
```bash
internal/reps/service.go       # Database operations and business logic
migrations/001_initial_schema.sql # Database schema with representatives table
```

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ Store and update representative information
- ✅ Deduplicate representatives using external IDs
- ✅ State-based filtering for user's representatives
- ✅ API endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations

## Phase 4: Letter Generation Engine (PARTIALLY COMPLETED ✅/🔧)

```

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED VIA AI INTEGRATION**
- ✅ AI-powered letter generation workflow working
- ✅ Integration with representatives data
- ✅ Theme and tone customization via AI prompts
- ✅ Variable substitution (name, representative, ZIP, etc.)
- ✅ Letter validation and formatting
- ✅ Representative selection via AI logic
- 🔧 **Missing:** Letter persistence to database

**Status: Planned (lower priority - AI generation working)**
- ✅ Template file structure and directory created
- ✅ Sample templates with YAML frontmatter created
- ❌ Template engine implementation
- ❌ Rotation strategies (random, sequential, unique)

## Current Achievement Summary

Lettersmith has successfully evolved from a foundation tool into a **working AI-powered advocacy system**. The core infrastructure and AI integration are complete and operational:

- ✅ **Full-stack web application** with intuitive configuration UI
- ✅ **Complete representatives system** with OpenStates API integration  
- ✅ **Robust system monitoring** with real-time health checks
- ✅ **AI letter generation** with OpenAI/Anthropic integration - generates personalized letters (≤500 words reliable)
- ✅ **Automatic representative selection** - AI chooses best representative based on issue analysis
- ✅ **Production-ready deployment** with Docker and PostgreSQL

**Known Limitations:**
- ⚠️ AI word count configuration: Works reliably for ≤500 words, struggles with longer requests
- ⚠️ Testing coverage: GPT-4 thoroughly tested, other AI models less tested

**Next Phase:** Implementing letter persistence and email sending will complete the full advocacy workflow, enabling users to automatically save and send their AI-generated privacy letters to representatives.
